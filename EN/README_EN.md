# Online Advertising - Click Prediction with Logistic Regression ðŸ“ŠðŸ’»

## Project Overview

This project applies **logistic regression** to predict the probability of a user clicking on an online ad, based on variables such as age, time spent on the site, average regional income, and daily internet usage.

The analysis includes **cross-validation**, **confusion matrix**, and classification metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**, aiming to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance across different data splits.

## Project Objectives

- Predict ad click probability based on user attributes.  
- Evaluate classification performance through multiple metrics.  
- Apply cross-validation to ensure model robustness.  
- Explore decision threshold adjustment to balance precision and recall.

## Dataset

The dataset is located in `data/advertising.csv` and includes:

- `Age`: User age  
- `Daily Time Spent on Site`: Time spent on the site  
- `Area Income`: Average income of the user's region  
- `Daily Internet Usage`: Daily internet usage (minutes)  
- `Clicked on Ad`: Target variable (1 = clicked, 0 = did not click)

## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

Results and Metrics
Average Accuracy: 97.0%

Average Precision: 98.2%

Average Recall: 95.8%

Average F1-score: 96.9%

These metrics were obtained using 5-fold cross-validation, demonstrating strong and consistent model performance in predicting ad clicks.
